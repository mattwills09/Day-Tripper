# Day-Tripper
___

Day Tripper is an app that makes visiting a new city, making last minute plans, or looking for places to eat, things to do, or sights to visit in any city in the world a breeze, providing recommended activities based on location and live weather.

The application is very easy to use, with users able to log into the app using Firebase's login fuctionality, and then entering their zip code.  From there, they are directed to the home page, where the current weather is shown for their location from an AJAX call to the OpenWeather API, and a suggestion is given as to what clothing they may need for the rest of the day, and also what activities would be suggested with the forecast.  After the user selects what category of activities they are interested in, another AJAX call is used to the Yelp API, and displays the results with all relevant information.  The user can then save shops or places they are interested in to their own personal list, and that can be saved or shared with their friends and family, or saved for later in the day.
