APIs Used:
Yelp - yelp-cat-search will use three arrays to find the appropriate searh categories to pass to the yelp api.
Weather -

The first array simply consists of activy setting categories, i.e. indooor, outdor, of both.
Based of the selected activity setting an array is searched for broad ranges of categories appropriate to the selected setting, i.e. Arts/Entertainment, Museums.
A third array links the selected category to the relevant search search terms defined in the yelp API, i.e.  "artmuseum", "planetarium".

The app is built initially to list the final yelp search terms on a web page. In the end the code is expected to be incorporated into the Day Tripper app and the yelp API calls used for it.
